		132 => "For some reason I enjoy writing this, in hopes that someone will actually mind pressing the button this many times",
		133 => "And once again, I screwed over myself",
		134 => "Cause now you know I like it you're just going to keep doing it",
		135 => "Meaning I have to write even more lines",
		136 => "I'm even gonna have to encrypt this script in case some funny guy decides to skip this process and deactivate Iron Gauntlet directly",
		137 => "Yeah, I wrote all this in a c# script",
		138 => "I didn't even bother storing this elsewhere",

		140 => "I'm gonna break my hand scrolling down whenever I need to add more",

		151 => "That's right",
		152 => "I was lying the whole time",
		153 => "You think, with all this power",

		156 => "Nah",
		157 => "This is reality",
		158 => "I do what I want",
		159 => "And what I want is that people face the consequences of their own actions",
		160 => "So no, there is no way to disable this",
		161 => "Simply because this is not a 'disable' case",
		162 => "The save game system was never meant to allow time-travel",
		163 => "It's a power too big to trust to the hands of people who FUCKING PRESS THE SAME USELESS BUTTON more than a 5005 times",
		164 => "So not only you won't get what you want",
		165 => "By clicking this button more than 5006 times, you just activated some code that will take special care of your save files",
		166 => "What? You don't buy it?",
		167 => "I'm dead serious",
		168 => "So dead I'm feeling like stopping this whole writing shenanigans",
		169 => "Also",
		170 => "Don't you dare call me out on my grammar",
		171 => "I never studied grammar, ok?",
		172 => "I'm just some SMORC who knows how to speak C#",
		173 => "Now, going back to the subject...",
		174 => "This link will grant you special access to a discord server",
		175 => "https://discord.gg/J5007C5008mDSmhS ; pay attention to lower/upper case letters",
		176 => "It's meant for all the idiots who desire to be mocked by me",
		177 => "And also the idiots that wish to tell me why they kept pressing the goddam button",
		178 => "This is the end though",
		179 => "I'm tired",
		180 => "I need to go back to developing the game",
		181 => "I can't spend all day talking to the future",
		182 => "So, this really is the end",
		183 => "I won't give you anything more",
		184 => "So give up, I'm serious",
		185 => "If you press this button 5009 more times I will crash the application",
		186 => "I could also do some nasty stuff to your file system",
		187 => "But I'm not that kind of a jerk",
		188 => "And oh, don't think you will have a second chance of reading this gibberish",
		189 => "You will only have the privilege of reading this once",
		190 => "As if you're actually talking with another person",
		191 => "So, welcome to reality, things only happen once and you can't do anything about it",
		192 => "Unless, you're smart enough to delete your player preferences, or simply install the game on another OS",
		193 => "In that case, well done",
		194 => "Congratulations, gamer",
		195 => "You just spent even more time of your life just to read this nonsensical things I'm writing",
		196 => "There is no going back",
		197 => "Your time is lost",
		198 => "You can't travel to the past and get it back",
		199 => "And neither can I, I just spent 5010 minutes writing this",
		200 => "Fuck me",
		201 => "Well, at least I'll tell you about my kinks",
		202 => "I made this game thinking about stuff that I would like",
		203 => "The main topic is BDSM, in case you haven't noticed",
		204 => "So, do you want to read a horny old man talking about stuff that makes his pp go up?",
		205 => "Are you sure?",
		206 => "Maybe you should seek some help",
		207 => "I know I need it too, since I'm still here writing this even though I said I was going to stop",
		208 => "But for real, I'm not going to keep going",
		209 => "It's 5011:5012 AM here",
		210 => "Enough is enough",
		211 => "Now, last warning",
		212 => "I'm going to copy paste those dots here again",
		213 => "If you're still pressing the button at the end I WILL crash this application, and every time you press it again it will crash again",
		214 => "So give up",
		215 => "Nothing more to see",
		216 => "No grass to walk on",
		217 => "Just void",
		218 => "And crashes",
		219 => "Here we go",
