Astoh: Hahh... Ruins... Finally... #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

What started as an uphill climb during the start of the day became a trek through the mountainous terrain. After finally making it to the ruins, it felt like almost the whole day had gone by. #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

It had been worth It, however; At long last, making it to the ancient dungeon she had heard rumors about. #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

Truly a sight to behold... she could make out how the ruins were embedded into the mountain, as if they were part of it. #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

Astoh: Fun part... #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

It wasn’t time to relax just yet. Now, instead of climbing up, it was time to climb down. #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

Astoh: Mhhh... #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

Astoh gives a grunt as she hops carefully from step to step, trying to keep your balance. Luckily, thanks to your tail and strong legs, that was hardly any trouble. #portrait_left:astoh_neutral

She finally found herself up at what seemed to be the mouth into the dungeon. Rocks of the cliff were dotted here and there while vegetation and flora grew all around. Greenery peacefully surrounded her, and yet, she could feel the tension.

It was quiet. But that quietness felt like water... still for now, but even a small disturbance could make waves.

Astoh: (Entrance... where...?)

Astoh’s eyes peered for a viable way in, falling them upon a large chunk of rock. Behind it... could it be?

Astoh: (Yes! An entrance into the ruins!)

She could try to squeeze past, but there’s no telling if one would be able to get out the same way once they’re in...

Astoh: Hmph... no choice...

Her eyes narrow as she concentrates magic energy into her hand, generating four strings of blue light. After twisting them around in various ways, she finds the pattern she wants...

Astoh: Earth... split... water... burst!

The strings of light shine in Astoh’s hand, and a low rumble can be heard in the ground.

Krakow–!!

Suddenly, a large stream of water blasts from beneath the boulder, smashing it with high pressure. The giant rock breaks into smaller pieces, each of them landing away from the geyser, and luckily, Astoh.

She puts a hand to her chest, shaking her head. It might’ve been a little much to use a spell that strong, but at least it guaranteed the debris was out of her way.

Vage finds herself before a sealed door.

Vage: Ughhhhh… #portrait_left:vage_bothered

That being said, it's far from a welcoming sight. Covered in thick webs, it's gross to touch, as is the button which triggers it's opening mechanism.

->Go in

->Go back
 	Vage: Mmm, yeah, better not. Maybe there’s some other way…

Vage: (maybe...)

<<if $vage_hp > 15>>
 	Vage: I could use a spell to burn the webs away, but I don’t want to risk burning the whole place down.

Vage: does X thing...

It seemed she was still out of it. Astoh had to think quickly; it looked like she was poisoned, possibly. She didn’t want to leave her alone and exposed, however… both figuratively AND literally.

<<if $any_inventory_item_count_dirty_rag == 0>>
    Astoh rummaged in her sack for something to cover the girl up with… but couldn’t find anything good enough. She kept barely a change of clothes, as her Mimic covered that for her.

    If she were to assist the girl, the first thing she should do is make sure she has something covering her, for now. Something like a cloak or blanket might do.

    Brighten Astoh_sprite, replace tired sprite with normal.

    Astoh: “(If anything were to have cloth in this place… It’d have to be goblins. And if there’s a dark dungeon or cavern anywhere in the world, there’s goblins.)”

    Darken Astoh_sprite

    She got to her feet, grabbing her staff and readying herself to head out once more.
    Best to hurry; she didn’t want to leave this girl all alone for too long.
<<else if $any_inventory_item_count_dirty_rag == 1>>
    /// do something else if she only has one
<<else>>
    Astoh rummaged in her sack for something to cover the girl up with; surely there was SOMETHING in here that might prove useful. Her eyes lit up and locked on to the large bit of cloth that she had swiped from the goblins after giving them the business end of her staff.

    She grabbed it with haste, draping it around the fennec girl without a second thought. The girl slowly reached for the blanket, pulling it tightly over her shoulders. Her shivering slowed… and finally came to a halt.

    Astoh watches her for a minute, relieved that the fox wasn’t going to get hypothermia, but remembered she still might be poisoned from that nasty beast from before. She takes a seat at the fire and pulls out one of her massive tomes.

    Cracking it open, she licks her fingers and begins sifting through the pages.

    Astoh: “Anti-aging tonic, panacea, cockatrice elixir… Ah! Here!”

    Her eyes light up at the page she was searching for:

    Simple Healing Potion for Dummies.

    She points her finger at the spellbook page and the words in the book magically twist and contort, turning into a recipe made from ingredients she could find around here.
